==== Pre requsities ====

python and  c++ 

Install python's numpy package

sudo apt-get install python-numpy  

Install GNU Linear programming kit for checking of optimality. For
ubuntu the software is obtainable by:

sudo apt-get install glpk  


==== Build ====

Make sure you run `make` to compile stakeout.cpp file


==== Execution ====

== Automated ==
To run automated scripting of many runs comparing the recursive,
dynamic approach to optimal type: 

python stakeout_driver.py

== Manual ==
To run the cpp file by hand type:

./stakeout    # with no arguments for default test
./stakeout 20 50 10 1 5   # with what args desired
