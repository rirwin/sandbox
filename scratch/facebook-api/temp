Can we talk about Desert Hearts Spring festival for a minute? \n\nSaturday night sunset was one of the most fun sets I've ever played. A large part of it was the timesot which fits my melodic dramatic (melodramatic??) sound which just felt right, but the other equally huge aspect was the awesome energy I was feeling from all you crazy kids on the dance floor. I love DJing for two reasons: first, the opportunity it gives me to share music I love, and second, the opportunity it gives me to connect with so many people...I really felt like I was able to connect with so many of you this weekend both on and off the decks.\n\nThese kinds of gigs are few and far between, and I'm grateful that the Desert Hearts crew invited me to be a part of it.\n\nAlso, huge shout-out to the awesome non-dance-music related aspects of the festival: Dmitri's Tea Lounge as quiet peaceful escape amongst the madness, the homies \u0040 Pile Palace keepin' me loose at all times, the lovely food vendors serving grilled cheese and tomato soup, and of course, all the really nice artwork+installations.\n\nThat Friday night blizzard, however....","privacy":{"value":""},"type":"status","created_time":"2014-04-28T22:45:27+0000","updated_time":"2014-04-29T01:08:13+0000","likes":{"data":[{"id":"100001715086655","name":"Ryan Black"},{"id":"100001152513093","name":"Maria Fernanda"},{"id":"3406860","name":"Travis Knight"},{"id":"1202294013","name":"Trevor Moseley"},{"id":"722983618","name":"John Henry King"},{"id":"1047240502","name":"Katie Sha'Dynasty Fritz"},{"id":"676685049","name":"Dominique Thibault"},{"id":"1143721762","name":"Andres Zambrano"},{"id":"100001894595527","name":"JT Zvetina"},{"id":"1533725048","name":"Andrea Cason"},{"id":"1348736488","name":"Eddie Vela"},{"id":"581560299","name":"Jen Loraine"},{"id":"1215434122","name":"Sebastian Cantillo"},{"id":"566376626","name":"Bethany Loehr"},{"id":"822070","name":"Brian Taylor"},{"id":"641833624","name":"Alissa Albert"},{"id":"677700587","name":"Zach Becks"},{"id":"31006526","name":"Colin Robinson"},{"id":"527936997","name":"Trav M\u00f8"},{"id":"1005453","name":"Prab Kumar"},{"id":"769044655","name":"Robert Michael Watson"},{"id":"546614745","name":"Ari Chopelas"},{"id":"1245795392","name":"Nereida Guadalupe Vital"},{"id":"505226607","name":"Lyja Stadlen-Brown"},{"id":"1334580134","name":"Ashley Koprowski"}],"paging":{"cursors":{"after":"MTMzNDU4MDEzNA==","before":"MTAwMDAxNzE1MDg2NjU1"},"next":"https:\/\/graph.facebook.com\/146418762059983_660343954000792\/likes?access_token=1496562830571575|1eFTzWkV41CLe1h2G0KdY4VG9Eo&limit=25&after=MTMzNDU4MDEzNA\u00253D\u00253D"}}},{"id":"100974433281665_706439789401790","from":{"category":"Health\/wellness website","name":"Mindy Wender","id":"100974433281665"},"message":"So as you guys know that my daughter was diagnosed with autism. We were looking to move someplace else to find more help for her like therapy etc. We found some help in NYC and to be honest I was LESS than thrilled to move from our super small town to a huge city. I mean if it was on a sunny beach MAYBE I would have been more excited lol. \n\nOne night I hit a wall of frustration because I just was PRAYING & PRAYING for a sign to let me know that moving was the right thing to do and if it wasn't then to give me a sign to where I should go. \n\nThe very next day a friend showed up on my door step with a book in her hand she purchased for me from her Dr's office. The Dr's was 1 hour from my home town and SPECIALIZED in autism. She told me she had been seeing Dr. Patrick Flynn for her health,nutrition, candida overgrowth , etc and just found out he specialized in autism & there was a school that provided therapy for autistic children!!! I literally said \"Ok God I HEAR YOU\" it was a sign and one I prayed about the night before. \n\nGod actually was trying to tell me this a week before all of this when brad's best friend emailed me Dr Flynn's contact info but I was so overwhelmed I never looked into it. \n\nNOW ... Lilly is doing awesome and her yeast is under control and so is her bacteria that she had in her system. We still have a long road but with Dr Flynn's help at The Wellness Way clinic & Dr Kartzinel we are seeing results!! \n\nDr Flynn works with people from all over and you do not have to be local to him. I highly recommend working with him.","story":"Mindy Wender shared Mindy Wender's photo.","story_tags":{"0":[{"id":"100974433281665","name":"Mindy Wender","offset":0,"length":12,"type":"page"}],"20":[{"id":"507175295","name":"Mindy Wender","offset":20,"length":12,"type":"user"}]},"picture":"https:\/\/fbcdn-photos-e-a.akamaihd.net\/hphotos-ak-frc3\/t1.0-0\/10273556_10154074171815296_6305088067788195985_s.jpg","link":"https:\/\/www.facebook.com\/photo.php?fbid=10154074171815296&set=a.10150730585595296.713739.507175295&type=1","name":"Mobile Uploads","caption":"I know you have been hearing a lot of people (especially coaches) talk about having candida overgrowth and how after figuring out all of their stuff they are finally feeling better etc etc. I gotta tell you that Lilly's Dr works with people (not just children) for these EXACT things and is VERY well known and trusted.
